This information could then be used to forecast future environmental pressures, such as increased demand for resources like water and food, or potential shifts in land use that could affect ecosystems.\n\nHowever, the actual environmental impact would depend on many factors, including the specific policies being implemented, the geographical location, and the existing environmental conditions.
